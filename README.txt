As we see whenever any crime related incidence happens then petitioner registers complaint to the police station.
But sometimes this process is so lengthy to do. The reason behind choosing these problem statements is that instead of manually, all the process is done in a computerized way.
All FIR data we made computerized and also 50 reports of CRIME ANALYSIS have been generated
So the transactional operations involved in the project are as:
1.	Complaint report:-giving details of complaint
2.	Affected area:-which city is suffering from which crime
3.	Reports of unidentified dead bodies & found missing person, most wanted ones.
4.	Reports helpful for researches to develop new safety tips.
5.	Superiors tracks details of their descendants with case status.
6.	Identification marks narrated by petitioner can be mapped with  those   stored of Accuse in DB. Helps in investigation.
